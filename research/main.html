<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
It is here that I am finding my passion.
As an operations management person, inefficiency makes me cringe.
As a human being, needless suffering is unconscionable.
By looking at health care operations, I can work on both problems simultaneously.

In a recent book, <a href="#wachter_digital_2015">wachter_digital_2015</a> (<a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Digital-Doctor-Hope-Medicines-Computer/dp/0071849467/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435381426&sr=8-1&keywords=digital+doctor">Amazon</a>), Robert Watcher makes the case that in the United States, people die as a result of medical errors at a rate of one jumbo get per day.
In the seminal, controversial book <a href="#america_err_2000">america_err_2000</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Err-Human-Building-Health-System/dp/0309261740/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435381688&sr=8-1&keywords=to+err+is+human">Amazon</a>) by the Committee on Quality of Health in America, 1/50 times a patient in a hospital is given a pill, it is not the pill that either the patient or the medical staff believe it to be.
These add to a huge body of anecdotes suggesting that there is room for improvement.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in using machine learning and optimization to improve health care quality.

<p>
I find machine learning extremely interesting and I have been working on adding to my skill set as a data scientist.
I took Andrew Ng's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">machine learning</a> course and Daphne Koller's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm">probabilistic graphical models course</a>.
During a seminar at the UW taught by Pat Bajari, I got introduced to Judea Pearl's work on <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/">causality</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>
Services like Uber, Instacart, Car2Go, Pronto, AirBnB, SpoonRocket, Caviar, and more are changing their respective industries. 
A few years ago, having groceries delivered was a service only accessible to the wealthy.
Taxi services were unreliable, paying in cash was cumbersome, and paying with cards even more so.
Due to the taxi's fixed pricing scheme, demand was not well matched with supply.
Renting a house from another individual was a high-risk gamble on the part of both the buyer and the seller.
All of these issues are quickly fading into oblivion.
</p>

<p>
On a personal level, these services have improved my life dramatically.
I try to take the bus as much as possible, but it is great to know that I can take an Uber when I need to, and the price of using Uber is far cheaper than leasing a second car.
</p>

<p>
From a operations perspective, being able to provide quality of service estimations becomes an interesting statistical problem.
There will be interesting and unexpected emergent behaviors by the agents.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Functional programming is the paradigm where functions in math behave like functions in code.
That is, they do not have side effects.  
\(f(x)\) is always \(f(x)\), regardless of what the rest of the universe is doing.
</p>

<p>
The difference between what a function is in <i>math</i> vs what it is in  <i>programming</i> can cause huge impedance mismatch.
I have observed this especially for people approaching programming from a math background.
There is some beautiful and interesting theory about the optimizations that are possible when functions are constrained in this way.
Also, functional programming has strong connections to category theory.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I have a working paper with my advisor and some other UW professors on inventory control in a 1-warehouse multiple-retailer setting, which constraints on what is known by the the involved parties.
As part of this project, I wrote a finite horizon dynamic program solver in Haskell.
I found finite horizon dynamic programming to be a natural fit for functional programming, and Haskell itself to be a very fun and efficient way of implementing a very performant solver.
