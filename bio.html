Prior to my time at the UW, I started a Finance PhD at the <a href="http://www.simon.rochester.edu/index.aspx">University of Rochester's Simon School of Business</a>. 
I enjoyed my time there, but the research was not a good fit.
I left with an MBA in 2012, transferring directly to the UW.

<p>
During my undergraduate, I studient <a href="https://www.math.washington.edu/acms/">Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences (ACMS)</a> and <a href="https://econ.washington.edu/">Economics</a> at the University of Washington.
